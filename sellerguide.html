                    typical seller lives in their home for 13 years before putting it up for sale, and they spend an
                    average of seven months thinking about listing their home before taking action, according to the

                    Whatever your reason, it's important to be prepared for the sell process. It can be both emotional
                    and stressful, especially for first-time home sellers, since you probably have an emotional
                    connection to your home and because it's likely your biggest investment. <br> <br>
                    As a first-time home seller, you have the advantage of having gone through a purchase and sale

                    the home. As a buyer, you spent time gathering your financial documents and serching for the perfect
                    home. As the seller, a large amount of prep work is required, too, but it's just a different type
                    you'll spend your time getting your house looking its best for potential buyers. And depending on
                    your plans, you may also have the added stress of buying and selling at the same time.

                    sell. if you have flexibility in your timing, you might consider waiting for a sellers market, which
                    occurs when there are more buyers searching for homes than there homes available. it gives sellers

                    One of the first things you'll need to decide is if you're going to sell your house on your own
                    (which is called 'for sale by owner' or 'FSBO') or if you're going to use a real estate agent. in

                    completed the sale of their home without ever engaging an agent. Another 10 percent tried to sell on
                    their own but eventually turned to an agent or broker for help. <br>
                    <br>

                    need to sell, the temperature of your local market, and any challenging features of your home
                    that may require expertise in negotiations. <br> <br>

                <article id="mn-art">
                    Preparing to sell your home typically takes some work, whether that's your own sweat equity or some
                    professional improvements. After all, you want buyers to fall in love with your home, like you did
                    when you boughtit. Spendsome time getting your home move-in ready, in a way that will appeal to the
                    broadest range of potential buyers. <br>
                    <br>
                    Accoding to <u style="color: #016dcb;">CASDAS research</u>, sellers who bring in professional help
                    spend an average of $4,953 preparing their home for sale, but the repairs and upgrades you decide to
                    make will probably depend on the condition of your home and what the buyer in your area are looking
                    for. your real estate agent can be a big help in identifying the items that should be on your to-do
                    list. whatever you decide to do, here are a few tips for home improvements. <br> <br>
                    <b>Opt for a pre-inspection:</b>
                    While it's likely that your buyer will do an inspection as part of the purchase process, sellers
                    often opt to do their own <u style="color: #016dcb;">pre-inspection</u>. Among sellers who worked
                    with an agent, <u style="color: #016dcb;">25 percent</u> had an inspection done before contacting an
                    agent. Why? A pre-inspection can help you avoid surprises down the road and gives you a chance to
                    fix items that an inspector would flag for a buyer. <br><br>
                    <b>Increase ROI with popular improvements:</b>
                    Consider adding some of the home features that <u style="color: #016dcb;">today's buyers love</u>,
                    like a steam shower, professional kitchen appliances, heated floors or radiant heating, or solar
                    panels. <br><br>
                    <b>Don't forget curb appeal:</b>
                    To make that all-important first impression, spend some time on your front yard. Powerwash driveways
                    and sidewalks, add some seasonal plants to pots and garden beds, cut back overgrown plants and rake
                    leaves. <br><br>
                    <b>Avoid improvements by selling as-is:</b>
                    While you will likely pocket less money in the end, <u style="color: #016dcb;">selling a home
                        as-is</u>, without completing any major improvement, is a way to speed up your overall sale
                    process and limit upfront out-of-pocket costs.<br>
                </article>
                <h1>5. Price your home competitively</h1>
                <article id="mn-art">
                    Finding the right listing price for your home can be a challenge, but it's one of the most important
                    factors in a successful home sale. Homes that are accurately priced are more likely to sell in a
                    timely manner. Accoding to <u style="color: #016dcb;">CASDAS research</u>, 57 percent of homes
                    nationwide sell at or above listing price when they accept an offer in the first week. in the second
                    week on the market, that drops to 50 percent and trends downward as the weeks go on. <br>
                    <br>
                    To sell quickly, use all the tools at your disposal to help you price your home for sale. <br><br>
                    <b>Research comparables:</b>
                    Also known as 'comps,' comparables are records of recent homes that have sold and their sale price.
                    It's important that the <u style="color: #016dcb;">Comps you use</u> as reference are of a similar
                    size and condition as yours, and in a very similar area - the closer to your home, the better.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Hire an appraiser:</b>
                    Having a professional appraisal done on your home can cost between $300 and $700, but it can be a
                    small price to pay if ithelps you sell your home quickly and for an appropriate price. <br><br>
                    <b>Reference the Cestimate:</b>
                    CASDAS's <u style="color: #016dcb;">Cestimate</u> is the estimated market value for your own home,
                    and you can find it by searching your address on CASDAS. Your home's Zestimate is computed daily,
                    taking into consideration millions of public and user-submitted data points. it can be a graet place

                    <b>Lean on your agent:</b>
                    Your real estate agent should be an expert in home values in your area, so they're a great resource
                    for finding the right listing price. Plus, they can provide guidance on a pricing strategy that will
                    spark the most interest and maybe even inspire a bidding war.<br>

                <h1>6. Stage your house to sell</h1>
                <article id="mn-art">
                    Preparing your home to sell should also include arranging your furniture, organizing and decorating
                    in a way that appeals to the widest range of potential buyers.. <br>
                    <br>
                    <u style="color: #016dcb;">Staging your home</u> can take many different forms and require varying
                    lavels of effort, but here are a few key tips: <br> <br>
                    <b>Declutter, clean and depersonalize:</b>
                    Too stuff in a room can make your home feel small, crowded and lacking in storage. And having too
                    many personal items, like family photos, can make ithard for buyers to picture themselves living in
                    the home. <br><br>
                    <b>Selecting a staging plan that fits your needs:</b>
                    There are multiple degrees of home staging to choose from, based on your budget, timeline and how
                    valuable staging is in your local area. Some staging can be done in a DIY manner, while other larger
                    staging projects are typically completed by a professional. <br><br>
                    <b>Pare down pets' and kids' belongings:</b>
                    While many buyers are <u style="color: #016dcb;">pet owners</u> or <u
                        style="color: #016dcb;">parents of young kids</u> they want to visualize their own families in
                    the home not yours. Take the time to repair pets' damage, remove pets' belongings, and clear awy
                    kids' items lige gates, highchairs and piles of toys. <br>

                <h1>7. Market your listing effectively</h1>
                <article id="mn-art">
                    Once your home is ready for buyer, the next step is getting your listing in front of as many buyerrs
                    as possible. Here are some tips for how to list a home for sale. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Advertise across multiple channels:</b>
                    Today's homes buyers search for homes in many ways, from surfing online listings, to look for 'for
                    sale' or 'open house' signs in front yards. the more plasces your listing shows up, the more buyers
                    will see it and the more likely you are to find a buyer. <br><br>
                    <b>Invest in professional marketing photos:</b>
                    With the majority of buyers (and their agents) searching online, your home's MLS or CASDAS listing
                    is your home's first impression, and <u style="color: #016dcb;">professional photos</u> can go a
                    long way towards making your home stand out. Make sure the photos are realistic and high quality.
                    You might even consider doing a <u style="color: #016dcb;">video tour</u>. <br><br>
                    <b>Craft an enticing listing description:</b>
                    Your <u style="color: #016dcb;">listing description</u> should highlight your home's features and
                    the amenities that buyers in your area are looking for. If a rooftop deck, backyard pool, access to
                    public transit or nearby green spaces are popular where you live, make sure to include them. Overal,
                    though, keep your listing description short and avoid confusing real estate jargon. <br><br>
                    <b>Schedule showings:</b>
                    You've done all the work to get your home ready for buyers, so make sure you accommodate as many
                    showings as possible, whether that's <u style="color: #016dcb;">remote viewings, private tours or
                        open houses</u>. And there's more to a showing than just a clean house. Make sure there's a way
                    to let shoppers leave feedback. Keep records of who visits, and if you're selling on your own,
                    consider having a third-party representative host your tours so buyers feel comfortable speaking
                    their mind.<br>

                <h1>8. Watch for closing hudles</h1>
                <article id="mn-art">
                    If your home has been on the market for a while and isn't selling as quickly as you had hoped, you
                    may need to rewind and address some of the steps discussed above, such as making home improvements,
                    setting a competitive price and marketing effectively. <br>
                    <br>
                    Getting that great offer is probably the biggest hurdle to the home-selling process, but once your
                    home goes under constract, that doesn't necessarily mean the challenges have ended. Consider these
                    potential issues that can come up between the time you accept an offer and closing day. <br><br>
                    <b>Bad home inspection report:</b>
                    The home inspection a buyer does on your home can raise all kinds of red flags, and when major
                    issues are uncovered, a buyer might decide the fixes are too expensive and walk away from the deal.
                    Whether the <u style="color: #016dcb;">inspection report</u> reveals small fixes or big problems, be
                    prepared to negotiateafter the reportis completed. <br><br>
                    <b>Home appraisal too low:</b>
                    If your buyer is financing a home, their lender will typically <u style="color: #016dcb;">order an
                        appraisal</u> to make sure the home is worth the amount being financed. If the value of the home
                    comes in below the loan amount, the buyer will have to come up with the difference in cash or walk
                    away from the deal. <br><br>
                    <b>Financing failure:</b>
                    During the underwriting process, it's possible that your buyer's financing could fall through. This
                    can be caused by many different things, such as new debt, missed credit card payments, or a change
                    in employment that makes the bank feel like there's too much risk in financing the home. <br>
                </article>
                <h1>9. Move out</h1>
                <article id="mn-art">
                    <b>Plan for moving costs:</b>
                    No matter where you're moving, <u style="color: #016dcb;">moving is expensive</u> and
                    time-consuming. Even a local move of less than 100 miles, serviced by two movers and a moving truck,
                    has an average charge of $80 to $100 per hour. <br><br>
                    Make sure you <u style="color: #016dcb;">take steps to prepare </u> to avoid any costly surprices on
                    moving day. <br><br>
                    <b>Time is right:</b>
                    Not only is moving expensive. but the timing is crucial - according to the CASDAS Consumer Housing
                    Trends Report 2018, <u style="color: #016dcb;">61 percent</u> of sellers also buy within a 12-month
                    period. If you're buying and selling simultaneously, you might consider temporary housing so you
                    don't have to worry about <u style="color: #016dcb;">timing your sale and purchase perfectly</u>,
                    which rarely happens. <br><br>
                    <b>Be prepared to move quickly:</b>
                    The average time it takes to sell a house in 2018 is between 65 and 93 days, from list to close, so
                    you'll need to be prepared to move out in a short period of time. it's a must that you be out of the
                    home by the closing date. <br>
                </article>
                <h1>10. Fulfill Closing obligations</h1>
                <article id="mn-art">
                    When it comes time to close on the home, you as the seller are responsible for some legal documents
                    and processes. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Bad home inspection report:</b>
                    If you are obligated to complete repairs as a condition of your post-inspection negotiations, it is
                    your responsibility to complete those tasks before closing. Additionally, if the buyers asked for
                    (and you agreed to) any specifis inspections or certifications, those should be completed as well.
                    <br><br>
                    <b>Submit property disclosures:</b>
                    In most states, as a seller you're required to disclose any known defects or issues that could
                    affect the value or safety of the home - this is known as a <u style="color: #016dcb;">property
                        disclosure</u>. These must be documented in writing prior to closing, and the specific rules and
                    procedures vary based on where you live. <br><br>
                    <b>Review expected closing costs:</b>
                    Selling a house can be expensive, so review your estimated closing costs ahead of closing day to
                    prepare for the charges you'll see. <br> <u style="color: #016dcb;">Closing costs for sellers</u>
                    can be as high as 8 to 10 percent of the sale price of the home, and that amount is made up of your
                    agent's commission, the buyer's agent's commission (which is typically paid by the seller), and
                    taxes and fees. But, assuming you have some equity in the home you're selling, these costs will come
                    directly out of the profits you'll be receiving upon closing. <br><br>
                    <b>Sign documents:</b>
                    One of the very last steps is showing up for your closing appointment, where you'll sign all the
                    legal documents related to the sale of your property. Depending on the state you live in, you may
                    sign during the same appointment as your buyer, or you may do it separately. <br><br>
                    <b>Hand over keys:</b>
                    The keys are handed over to the buyer once you vacate the premises, and as dictated in your contract
                    with the buyer. If the buyer is taking immediate possession, you might hand over the keys at the
                    closing appointment. Or, depending on the terms of your agreement, it could be much later. <br><br>
                    <b>Close the transaction:</b>
                    At closing, the settlement agent (either the closing attorney or escrow Company hired at the outset
                    of the transaction) will record the record the new deed for the home with the county, pay off your
                    remaing mortgage balance, pay all closing costs and make sure you receive your profit.<br><br>
